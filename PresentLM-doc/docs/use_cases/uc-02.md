# Scenario 2: Educators

When preparing a lecture, educators often know what they want to explain but struggle to formalize it beyond slide bullet points. Using PresentLM, an educator uploads their slides and optional notes. The system generates a draft narration aligned to each slide, allowing the educator to listen, revise, and improve the flow of explanations. This helps them refine how content is presented and reuse the narration in future lectures or as supporting material for students.
