# Scenario 3: Professionals

Professionals often prepare presentations under time pressure and rehearse alone. With PresentLM, a professional uploads their slides and generates a spoken narration that follows the intended presentation flow. By listening to the narration and watching the slides advance in sync, they can evaluate timing, transitions, and clarity. During rehearsal, they can ask questions or request alternative explanations, helping them refine what to say before presenting to a real audience.
