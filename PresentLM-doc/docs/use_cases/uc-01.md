# Scenario 1: Students

Students often receive lecture slides without the spoken explanation that was given in class. Using PresentLM, a student can replay the lecture as an interactive experience. The system narrates each slide in order and moves through the deck automatically. While listening, the student can stop and ask questions about the current slide to get more explanation, helping them study independently and more confidently.
