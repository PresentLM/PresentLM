# PresentLM Prototype

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>
  PresentLM is a prototype that explores how generative AI can support spoken presentation and explanation through synchronized narration, slide progression, and interactive questioning.  
  The system treats slides as temporal reference points and focuses on <strong>what is said</strong>, <strong>when it is said</strong>, and <strong>how it is explained</strong>.

## Why PresentLM?

There are significant advantages to practicing and consuming presentations in an AI-mediated, interactive environment:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '1em', margin: '2em 0' }}>
  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Explainable Presentations</strong>  
    <em>Slides are accompanied by structured spoken narration, making explanations explicit rather than implicit.</em>
  </div>

  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Realistic Rehearsal</strong>  
    <em>Presenters can experience the flow, pacing, and transitions of a presentation without a live audience.</em>
  </div>

  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Active Learning</strong>  
    <em>Learners can pause, replay, and ask questions at any moment, transforming passive slide decks into interactive learning experiences.</em>
  </div>

  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Reusable Knowledge</strong>  
    <em>Spoken explanations are captured and can be reused across lectures, semesters, or presentations.</em>

## Core Problems

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '1em' }}>
  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Presentations lose meaning when speech is missing</strong>  
    <em>Slides alone do not convey reasoning, emphasis, or narrative structure.</em>
  </div>

  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Rehearsal lacks interaction and feedback</strong>  
    <em>Practicing alone offers no sense of timing, flow, or alternative explanations.</em>
  </div>

  <div style={{ padding: '1em', borderRadius: '8px', flex: '1 1 250px', maxWidth: '300px' }}>
    <strong>Learning from slides is passive</strong>  
    <em>Students cannot ask questions or request clarification when reviewing content independently.</em>
  </div>

## Human-in-the-Loop Interaction

We believe the human should always remain in control of the presentation experience.

- **Narration and interaction are explicitly user-initiated**
- **Users decide when to listen, pause, ask questions, or explore deeper explanations**
- **The AI acts as a supportive presenter or explainer, not an autonomous authority**

---

## Interaction Transparency

To support trust and clarity, the system emphasizes transparency:

- **Clear indication of which slide is being explained**
- **Visual cues showing whether the system is narrating or responding to a question**
- **Explicit transitions between presentation flow and interactive explanation**

## Social Ecosystem

### Context

**Key Points**: Presentation practice · Explainable communication · Learning and rehearsal · Human–AI interaction

We envision PresentLM as an interactive presentation and explanation tool designed to support how people prepare, deliver, and consume spoken content. The system focuses on shaping the spoken layer of presentations — what is said, how it is explained, and how the flow unfolds over time — rather than the visual design of slides. By synchronizing narration, slides, and dialogue, PresentLM supports clarity, confidence, and understanding in presentation-based communication.
